# Guitar Chord Trainer

Welcome to the Guitar Chord Trainer. The point of this project is to help aid those who are learning to play guitar practice their chord changes. It will do this by adding a bit of randomness to the process.

This project is in a rather infantile stage the moment. I am currently mocking it up using Java's Swing toolkit, but I fully admit I do not know if the end result will be in java. I have kicked the tires at potentially making it a Django application or something along those lines. The reason for this uncertainty is that I could see a lot of people practicing guitar without a computer in front of them. So providing a means to use this on their phones, tablets and things of that nature would be beneficial to them.
